The HealthBridge Ontology project addresses key components of the national health information system, with a particular focus on the connections between different stakeholders at this level, as well as their interactions with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the national scale. The ontology is designed to reflect two complementary perspectives:

1.Healthcare provider perspective – as system managers and designers who define and deliver healthcare services.
2.Citizen perspective – as customers of healthcare services and connection of them with healthcare services and software products.

This project presents the ontology of the national health information system, covering two main areas of focus: eHealth functions and eHealth network requirements. eHealth functions such as eHealth services for both citizens and healthcare professionals. Additionally  eHealth network requirements are requirement for managing health information network. In addition, the project introduces an ontology for the personal health information system, which addresses citizens’ healthcare functions across different contexts, statuses, and hierarchical levels.

The HealthBridge Ontology is designed within a three-layered ontology architecture, comprising the Top-Level Ontology, the Core Ontology, and the Domain-Specific Ontology.

1. The Top-Level Ontology is developed following the General Formal Ontology (GFO) methodology, providing a foundational framework of high-level abstractions.
2. The Core Ontology functions as an intermediary layer, linking the top-level concepts with specific applications. It emphasizes three key domain connections: eHealth functions, citizen healthcare functions, and eHealth network requirements.
3. The Domain-Specific Ontology extends the framework to practical applications, with each of the three domains addressed in dedicated studies.
