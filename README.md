The HealthBridge Ontology project addresses key components of the national health information system, with a particular focus on the connections between different stakeholders at this level, as well as their interactions with the Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the national scale.
The ontology is designed to reflect two complementary perspectives:
    • Healthcare provider perspective – as system managers and designers who define and deliver healthcare services.
    • Citizen perspective – as customers of healthcare services and connection of them with healthcare services and software products.
    This project presents the ontology of the national health information system, covering two main areas of focus: eHealth functions and eHealth network requirements. eHealth functions such as eHealth services for both citizens and healthcare professionals. Additionally  eHealth network requirements are requirement for managing health information network. In addition, the project introduces an ontology for the personal health information system, which addresses citizens’ healthcare functions across different contexts, statuses, and hierarchical levels.
